#Servers

Whatever server is set up, it's wise to SSH into it from your working computer.


##Remote Servers

A simple option for a remote machine is a Digital Ocean droplet. We currently use a $5/month plan.


##Local Servers

We can use Pis (see `raspberry-pi.md`) or our local machines as servers.

To configure the accessibility of these servers (e.g. the internet, local networks), see `network.md`.
