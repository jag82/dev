#README.md


##Documentation

This README is a starting point for all documentation (TODO: restructure after first run). Since we're likely to run into problems related to following the directions in these files, I propose the use of [a private version of StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/channels) as a kind of FAQ with relevant answers.
